# Security HomeLab With Wazuh XDR and SIEM
Deploying Wazuh XDR and SIEM tool on Proxmox Virtual Environment

My goal in putting up this lab environment is to gain **an understanding of Wazuh's features** and operational capabilities in order to practise **endpoint security**. Since mobile devices, cloud usage, and remote work eliminated conventional network perimeters, endpoint security has become crucial for modern businesses, as every endpoint can be attacked. Organisations require real-time endpoint detection, response, and ongoing monitoring to maintain their security posture because sophisticated attacks are evading perimeter defences. This lab demonstratesÂ **practical XDR skills**, threat hunting abilities, and incident response procedures necessary for safeguarding today's dispersed enterprise networks.
